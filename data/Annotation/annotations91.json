(2000)\u00a0described 2 French Canadian patients from 2 unrelated families who presented with severe salt-wasting HSD3B deficiency (201810) in infancy. Although the diagnosis was considered clinically, plasma steroid profiles were confusing.\u00a0Alos et al. (2000)\u00a0directly sequenced DNA fragments generated by PCR amplification of the 4 exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the 5-prime-flanking regions of the\u00a0HSD3B2\u00a0gene. Sequencing of exon 2 revealed a C-to-A transversion in both alleles of both cases, resulting in an ala10-to-glu substitution (GCA to GAA). This ala is highly conserved in the vertebrate HSD3B gene family and is located in the putative NAD-binding domain of the enzyme. The mutant\u00a0HSD3B2\u00a0enzyme exhibited no detectable activity in intact transfected Ad293 cells. Both homozygous patients shared the same haplotype, spanning approximately 3.3 cM surrounding the\u00a0HSD3B2\u00a0gene, consistent with a founder effect for this missense mutation. The 46,XY patient presented with ambiguous genitalia at birth and underwent normal masculinization at puberty, but was azoospermic at 18.5 years of age. The 46,XX patient presented progressive breast development, menarche, and evidence of progesterone secretion","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":408,"end":423},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":464,"end":476},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":508,"end":520},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":537,"end":549},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":611,"end":616},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":664,"end":671},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":686,"end":692},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":698,"end":718},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":729,"end":731},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":743,"end":751},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":881,"end":896},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":949,"end":957},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T10"}]}
