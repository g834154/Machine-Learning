(2002).\u00a0 \u000B\u000BIn a family of Welsh-Scottish-German origin in which 8 members had alcohol-responsive myoclonus-dystonia (see\u00a0159900),\u00a0Klein et al. (1999)\u00a0identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the first base of codon 154 of the DRD2 gene, resulting in a val154-to-ile (V154I) substitution. By in vitro functional expression assay,\u00a0Klein et al. (2000)found that the V154I-mutant protein was similar to wildtype and did not show impaired activity. In the same family,\u00a0Klein et al. (2002)identified a 5-bp deletion in the SGCE gene (604149.0005) in all 8 affected members. The mutation resulted in a frameshift and premature stop. There were 2 unaffected carriers of both mutations. The contribution of each mutation to the clinical phenotype could not be determined, but the phenotype most likely resulted from the SGCE mutation, as\u00a0Klein et al. (2000)\u00a0showed that the V154I DRD2 mutant protein was similar to wildtype and did not show impaired activity in in vitro studies.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":5,"end":12},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":302,"end":312},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":347,"end":360},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":362,"end":374},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":399,"end":411},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":494,"end":500},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":501,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":541,"end":544},"obj":"Neg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":550,"end":558},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":559,"end":567},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":626,"end":634},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":638,"end":651},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":697,"end":705},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":706,"end":717},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":735,"end":749},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":792,"end":801},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":828,"end":836},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":918,"end":931},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":936,"end":940},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":941,"end":949},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":996,"end":1000},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1007},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1015},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1051},"obj":"Neg"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1065},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1074},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R17","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R19","pred":"Neg","subj":"T27","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R21","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"Neg","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"}]}
