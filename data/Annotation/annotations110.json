(2006) identified a 2572C-T transition in exon 15 of the SCN9A gene, resulting in a leu858-to-phe (L858F) substitution in the linker region between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 in domain 2. The asymptomatic father was found to be a somatic mosaic for the mutation, which was present in 13% of his leukocytes. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the L858F protein caused a hyperpolarizing shift in channel activation, a depolarizing shift of inactivation, and an 18-fold increase in deactivation time compared to wildtype. In addition, the mean ramp current amplitude in response to slow depolarization was higher in L858F-mutant channels. The mutation was not identified in 200 alleles from Chinese controls. \r\n\r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":98,"end":108},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":123,"end":137},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":139,"end":151},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":188},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":327,"end":335},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":436,"end":449},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":450,"end":456},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":459,"end":480},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":492,"end":502},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":506,"end":524},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":528,"end":540},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":557,"end":565},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":569,"end":581},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":674,"end":688},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":693,"end":699},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":730,"end":738},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"}]}
