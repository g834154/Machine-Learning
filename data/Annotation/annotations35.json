(2000)\u00a0described a nonmosaic XY sex-reversed female with pure gonadal dysgenesis, including 46,XY karyotype, completely female external genitalia, normal mullerian ducts, absence of wolffian ducts, and streak gonads (SRXY1;\u00a0400044), who harbored a yolk-sac tumor and was referred for the assessment of primary amenorrhea. They identified a novel de novo mutation, a G-to-A transition at position 284 within the HMG box of the\u00a0SRY\u00a0gene, resulting in a gly95-to-glu substitution. This mutation was not detected in the patient's father or in her male sibs. The authors concluded that these data provide further evidence to support the functional importance of the putative DNA-binding activity of the\u00a0SRY\u00a0HMG box","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":371,"end":379},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":390,"end":400},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":439,"end":451},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":453,"end":465},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":481,"end":493},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":500,"end":508},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":691,"end":698},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":699,"end":707},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"}]}
