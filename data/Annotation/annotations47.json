(2001)\u00a0identified a homozygous 773C-T transition in exon 7 of the HADH gene, resulting in a pro258-to-leu (P258L) substitution in 1 of the alpha-helices of the C-terminal domain. The mutation was predicted to prevent normal protein folding. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant enzyme had no catalytic activity. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.\u00a0Clayton et al. (2001)\u00a0postulated that the increased insulin secretion in this patient was related to impaired fatty acid oxidation and suggested that a lipid signaling pathway may be involved in the control of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":124,"end":134},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":148,"end":161},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":163,"end":175},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":200,"end":212},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":269,"end":277},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":295,"end":302},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":310,"end":325},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":382,"end":395},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":400,"end":402},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":403,"end":421},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":461,"end":469},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":513,"end":522},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":523,"end":540},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":572,"end":580},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":581,"end":601},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":623,"end":646},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":670,"end":677},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":681,"end":698},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R17","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R18","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"}]}
