In a study comparing patients after myocardial infarction (MI) with controls,\u00a0Cambien et al. (1992)\u00a0found association between coronary heart disease and the\u00a0ACE/ID polymorphism. They determined that the frequency of the\u00a0ACE/DD genotype in the 'general population' is approximately 0.27. The\u00a0ACE\u00a0polymorphism was unrelated to blood pressure and hypertension.\u00a0Cambien et al. (1992)\u00a0estimated that in the low-risk group, i.e., those without tobacco usage, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, or hypercholesterolemia, the\u00a0ACE/DD genotype may account for 35% of cases of myocardial infarction. The results of these studies correlate with those of\u00a0Pfeffer et al. (1992), which showed that administration of an ACE\u00a0inhibitor not only decreased the risk of developing heart failure but also reduced the risk for recurrent myocardial infarction. Experimental studies had shown that\u00a0ACE\u00a0gene expression is increased in myocardial tissue after coronary artery occlusion","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":434,"end":454},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":855,"end":868},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":878,"end":887},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":934,"end":941},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1019,"end":1032},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1043},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1056},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
