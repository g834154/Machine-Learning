(2014)\u00a0identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion (c.151_153delAAG) in exon 1 of the\u00a0GLRX5gene, resulting in the deletion of conserved residue lys51 (K51del), which is in the glutaredoxin domain. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping and sequencing of candidate genes involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, segregated with the disorder in both families and was not found in 172 Lebanese controls. Patient cells showed normal\u00a0GLRX5\u00a0protein levels, but there were reduced to absent levels of lipoate on the E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) complexes compared to controls; lipoate levels normalized after transfection with wildtype\u00a0GLRX5. A Chinese patient with a similar phenotype was subsequently found to be compound heterozygous for the K51del mutation and an 8-bp insertion (c.82_83insGCGTGCGG;\u00a0609588.0005), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Gly28GlyfsTer25). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 188 control Chinese alleles. The findings suggested that\u00a0GLRX5\u00a0likely functions in the pathway that provides an iron-sulfur cluster to lipoate synthase","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":160,"end":168},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":200,"end":213},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":215,"end":227},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":232,"end":240},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":319,"end":327},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":397,"end":402},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":565,"end":578},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":579,"end":585},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":613,"end":619},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":620,"end":626},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":951,"end":959},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":972,"end":981},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1029},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1042},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1068},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1141,"end":1150},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1245},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1252,"end":1261},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1276},"obj":"Pathway"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"}]}
