(2001) reported a family in which 3 individuals had nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism (609152) caused by a mutation in the TSHR gene, resulting in a gly431-to-ser (G431S) substitution in in transmembrane domain-1 of the protein. The mutation was found in the investigated patient, his father, and the paternal grandmother. As observed in other familial cases of nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism, the age of onset of the disease was variable, ranging from early childhood in the patient and his father to adolescence in the grandmother. Functional characterization of this mutation showed a constitutive activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system. The authors concluded that constitutively activating mutations can be found in the entire transmembrane domain region of the TSHR, indicating the important role of all parts of the transmembrane domain region for maintaining the inactive receptor conformation. \r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":129},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":133,"end":146},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":148,"end":160},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":185,"end":197},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":234,"end":241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":247,"end":255},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":583,"end":591},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":614,"end":624},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":632,"end":658},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":702,"end":712},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":713,"end":722},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
