(1991)\u00a0identified a homozygous ser106-to-pro (S106P) substitution in the CYP17A1 gene. Functional expression studies showed that the mutation abolished both 17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity.Jones et al. (1992)\u00a0reported clinical details of the patients, both of whom were phenotypic females with 46,XY karyotype and who had hypertension. The finding of the identical defect in 2 presumably unrelated individuals from a relatively small population suggested to\u00a0Jones et al. (1992)\u00a0that the gene might be frequent in that population.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":166,"end":178},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":182,"end":198},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":246,"end":254},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":255,"end":264},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":270,"end":290},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":295,"end":306},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":307,"end":315},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":614,"end":618},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"}]}
