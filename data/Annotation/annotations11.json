(2013)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp insertion (c.1906_1907insC) in exon 14 of the\u00a0PIK3R1\u00a0gene, causing a frameshift predicted to generate a premature termination codon (Asn636ThrfsTer18). The mutation was not found in her unaffected parents. Functional analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cells showed decreased phosphorylation of the downstream S6 target of the PI3K-AKT (see\u00a0164730)-mTOR (601231) pathway.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":117,"end":126},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":159,"end":174},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":176,"end":183},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":186,"end":196},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":210,"end":218},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":221,"end":248},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":273,"end":281},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":382,"end":391},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":392,"end":407},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":443,"end":486},"obj":"Pathway"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"}]}
