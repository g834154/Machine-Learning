(2004)\u00a0reported a novel 8-bp microdeletion of SF1, isolated from a 46,XY patient who presented with gonadal agenesis but normal adrenal function (SRXY3;\u00a0612965), that causes premature termination upstream of sequences encoding the activation function-2 domain. In cell transfection experiments, the mutated protein possessed no intrinsic transcriptional activity but rather inhibited the function of the wildtype protein in most cell types. The authors stated that this was the first example of an apparent dominant-negative effect of an SF1 mutation in humans. The authors concluded that these findings, which defined an SF1 mutation that apparently differentially affects its transcriptional activity in vivo in the adrenal cortex and the gonads, may be relevant to patients who present with 46,XY sex reversal but normal adrenal functions.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":43,"end":56},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":60,"end":63},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":209},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":245,"end":255},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":256,"end":264},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":313,"end":320},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":321,"end":328},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":339,"end":341},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":352,"end":376},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":388,"end":397},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":402,"end":410},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":552,"end":555},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":556,"end":564},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":636,"end":639},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":640,"end":648},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":680,"end":687},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":692,"end":716},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"}]}
