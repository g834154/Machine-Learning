(2013)\u00a0identified a -5T-A transversion in intron 3 (c.593-5T-A) of the\u00a0TBX22\u00a0gene, within the conserved splice acceptor consensus sequence for exon 4. The mutation was present in heterozygosity in the obligate carrier mother and was not found in the dbSNP database or in 539 control chromosomes. In vitro mRNA splicing assay showed significant reduction in or absence of a 471-bp fragment generated with the wildtype construct when the mutant construct was used. In addition, clonal sequence analysis of RT-PCR products showed that the c.593-5T-A mutation results in a significant increase in the most upstream cryptic splice site product with little wildtype product detected, suggesting that the mutation weakens or abolishes the wildtype acceptor splice site of exon 4.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":199,"end":211},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":240,"end":254},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":328,"end":336},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":517,"end":526},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":533,"end":540},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":609,"end":615},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":720,"end":728},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":754,"end":762},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":871,"end":879},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":880,"end":887},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":891,"end":900},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T3"}]}
