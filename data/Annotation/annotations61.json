(2004)\u00a0identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion, TTTT, near the 3-prime end of intron 3 of the CYP17A1 gene. RNA derived from the TTTT deletion skipped exon 4 entirely, deleting 29 amino acids in-frame; cells expressing the mutant gene had no 17-hydroxylase activity. The diagnosis in the patient had been based on extremely elevated 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone values, and failure of pubertal progression","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":158,"end":166},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":210,"end":226},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":262},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":288,"end":296},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":343,"end":349},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":359,"end":361},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":377,"end":385},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":444,"end":452},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":507,"end":514},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":518,"end":538},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}
