(2012)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the\u00a0DHTKD1\u00a0gene, an A-to-G transition affecting the initiating methionine codon and a nonsense mutation (614984.0002). The 1A-G mutation was predicted to cause out-of-frame usage of the next AUG triplet 160 nucleotides downstream and thus result in a nonfunctional protein. This mutation was also identified in the patient's mother.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":134},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":138,"end":153},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":165,"end":175},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":233,"end":241},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":266,"end":274},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":292,"end":297},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":298,"end":316},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":377,"end":386},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":389,"end":402},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":417,"end":425},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T7"}]}
