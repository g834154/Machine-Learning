(1998)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene:\u00a0TPMT*3A (187680.0002) and a new variant allele,TPMT*4A, caused by a G-to-A transition that disrupted the acceptor splice junction at the final 3-prime nucleotide of intron 9. The new allele was found to cosegregate with reduced\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity within an extended kindred. The mutation was found to lead to generation of at least 2 aberrant mRNA species. The first resulted from use of a novel splice site located 1 nucleotide 3-prime downstream from the original splice junction. This mRNA species contained a single nucleotide deletion and a frameshift in exon 10, the terminal exon of the gene. The second novel mRNA species resulted from activation of a cryptic splice site located within intron 9, leading to inclusion of 330 nucleotides of intron sequence. That sequence contained a premature translation termination codon.\u00a0TPMT*4 was the first reported allele for low\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity as a result of a mutation within an intron","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":148},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":152,"end":165},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":242,"end":252},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":258,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":387,"end":408},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":441,"end":449},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":471,"end":481},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":693,"end":701},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":708,"end":718},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":756,"end":760},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":806,"end":816},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":867,"end":877},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":953,"end":986},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1052},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1053,"end":1067},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1078},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T11"}]}
