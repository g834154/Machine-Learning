(2004) identified a heterozygous 1073G-A transition in exon 10 of the MPL gene, resulting in a ser505-to-asn (S505N) substitution. Cellular studies showed that mutant cells had increased cytokine-independent survival and constitutively phosphorylated Mek1/2 (see, e.g., 176872), suggesting that S505N is an activating mutation. \r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":154,"end":164},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":179,"end":191},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":193,"end":205},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":230,"end":242},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":273,"end":279},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":290,"end":299},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":321,"end":329},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":420,"end":430},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":431,"end":439},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}
