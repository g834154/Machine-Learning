(2004)\u00a0demonstrated a 6-bp deletion that removed the acceptor splice site adjacent to exon 5 of the HADH gene. They demonstrated that exon 5 is skipped during the mRNA splicing process, so that exon 4 is coupled directly onto exon 6. This led to an in-frame deletion of 90 nucleotides in the mature mRNA, resulting in a protein product predicted to lack 30 amino acids. Both parents were heterozygous.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":206,"end":214},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":220,"end":227},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":275,"end":288},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":342,"end":355},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":437,"end":445},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":528,"end":532},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"}]}
