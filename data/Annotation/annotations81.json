(2014)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (c.1128_1129insT, NM_014362.3) in the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Lys377Ter). The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Variant Server databases. Patient cells showed no detectable\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0enzymatic activity.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":180,"end":189},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":224,"end":238},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":252},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":255,"end":265},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":270,"end":291},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":309,"end":317},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":550,"end":552},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":564,"end":569},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":570,"end":588},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"}]}
