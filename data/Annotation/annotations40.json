(2004) identified a homozygous 22-bp deletion in exon 10 of the GHR gene. The mutation was predicted to result in frameshift introducing novel codons from positions 424 through 449 followed by premature termination at codon 450. The predicted protein would lack a large portion of the intracellular domain. In the truncated protein, the membrane proximal region containing Box1 and Box2, critical for activation of JAK2 (147796) and STAT3 (102582), would be intact, but the protein would lack the C-terminal tyrosine residues essential for STAT5 (601511) activation. No STAT5 activity was detected in cells expressing the truncated protein, consistent with its lack of a STAT5 binding site. The authors concluded that the loss of signaling through the STAT5 pathway results in growth hormone insensitivity syndrome.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":156,"end":164},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":179,"end":191},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":197,"end":205},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":223,"end":232},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":233,"end":243},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":312,"end":333},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":362,"end":369},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":376,"end":380},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":443,"end":450},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":520,"end":530},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":534,"end":538},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":552,"end":557},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":593,"end":600},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":607,"end":611},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":659,"end":664},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":674,"end":684},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":689,"end":694},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":695,"end":703},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":751,"end":758},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":780,"end":784},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":790,"end":795},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":796,"end":803},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":849,"end":858},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":871,"end":876},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":877,"end":884},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":885,"end":895},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T24"}]}
