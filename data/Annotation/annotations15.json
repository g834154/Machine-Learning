(2004)\u00a0reported a heterozygous SF1 gene mutation, a C-to-A transversion in exon 2 that replaced cys16 with a stop codon (C16X). The patient showed low basal levels of anti-mullerian hormone (600957) and testosterone (T), weak T response to chorionic gonadotropin (see\u00a0118860), and hypoplastic testes with abundant seminiferous tubules but rare germ cells. This mutation caused premature termination of translation and should abolish all SF1 activity; therefore, haploinsufficiency could explain the deleterious effect of this mutation, suggesting that testis development is more SF1 dose-dependent than adrenal development. The authors concluded that heterozygous mutation can impair adrenal development only if the 2 mechanisms, gene dosage and dominant-negative effects, occur.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":137,"end":145},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":146,"end":154},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":165,"end":177},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":193,"end":201},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":215,"end":225},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":253,"end":256},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":327,"end":331},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":334,"end":342},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":467,"end":475},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":476,"end":482},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":483,"end":504},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":508,"end":519},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":531,"end":538},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":543,"end":546},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":547,"end":555},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":605,"end":616},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":632,"end":640},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":658,"end":676},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":685,"end":688},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":709,"end":728},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":770,"end":778},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":783,"end":789},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":790,"end":809},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":836,"end":840},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T15"}]}
