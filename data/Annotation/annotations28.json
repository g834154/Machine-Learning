(1996)\u00a0characterized the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0gene from 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with AHC (300200), and found 5 novel mutations including 3 nonsense and 2 frameshift mutations. The nonsense mutations were a C-to-T transition (gln395-to-ter; Q395X), a C-to-G transversion (tyr271-to-ter; Y271X;\u00a0300473.0010), and a C-to-A transversion (tyr91-to-ter; Y91X;\u00a0300473.0011). The Y91X mutation was found in 2 sibs. The frameshift mutations were a 2-bp deletion (1610delAT) and a 1-bp (G) insertion resulting in a premature stop at codon 462 (300473.0012), and a 1-bp deletion (1169delC), resulting in a frameshift which caused a premature stop codon at position 371 (300473.0013). A 21-year-old male patient in whom the Q395X mutation was identified had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; the other 5 patients were prepubertal. All mutated NR0B1 proteins had truncated C-terminal domains, suggesting that these 5 mutations cause AHC and that the C terminus of theDAX1\u00a0protein, especially the terminal 11 amino acids, is necessary for normal adrenal cortical embryogenesis.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":120,"end":129},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":167},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":168,"end":177},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":192,"end":201},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":216,"end":226},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":260,"end":272},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":323,"end":335},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":380,"end":388},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":414,"end":424},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":425,"end":434},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":447,"end":455},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":483,"end":492},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":493,"end":505},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":508,"end":522},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":562,"end":570},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":583,"end":595},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":598,"end":608},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":624,"end":644},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":721,"end":729},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":823,"end":830},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":831,"end":845},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":904,"end":913},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":914,"end":919},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":951,"end":966},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1062},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T24"}]}
