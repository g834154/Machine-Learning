(2002),\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)\u00a0identified a 776G-C transversion in exon 6 of the\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0gene, resulting in a glu249-to-gln (E249Q) substitution.\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0protein levels in patient fibroblasts were about 50% of normal controls. The mutation appeared to affect HSD10 subunit interactions, resulting in an allosteric regulatory enzyme. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the mutant protein was unable to catalyze the dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA and the oxidation of allopregnanolone at low substrate concentrations.\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)postulated that the neurologic phenotype was due to an imbalance in neurosteroid metabolism.\u00a0Yang (2014)corrected the nucleotide transversion to 745C-T.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":144,"end":156},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":170,"end":187},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":201},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":226,"end":238},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":239,"end":263},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":326,"end":334},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":347,"end":353},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":368,"end":380},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":382,"end":394},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":398,"end":408},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":420,"end":426},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":482,"end":496},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":501,"end":507},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":524,"end":539},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":581,"end":590},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":682,"end":702},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":717,"end":726},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":730,"end":753},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":791,"end":803},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R18","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R20","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T12"}]}
