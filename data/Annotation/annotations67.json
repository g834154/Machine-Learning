(1997)\u00a0sequenced the\u00a0CYP17\u00a0gene from a Japanese patient with combined complete 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (202110) previously reported by\u00a0Yazaki et al. (1982). The patient was homozygous for a G-to-A transition at position +5 of the 5-prime splice site of intron 7. In vitro expression analysis of an allelic minigene containing exons 6-8 of the mutant gene showed skipping of exon 7. This exon skipping alters the translational reading frame of exon 8 and introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid position 410, proximal to the heme iron-binding site essential for the enzymatic activity ofCYP17. Restriction enzyme analysis showed that the patient was homozygous and the parents were heterozygous for the mutation.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":234,"end":244},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":380,"end":386},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":387,"end":391},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":399,"end":407},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":429,"end":437},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":449,"end":462},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":504,"end":518},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":579,"end":586},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":610,"end":628},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":629,"end":636},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":747,"end":755},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T8"}]}
