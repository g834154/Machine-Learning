(1998)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the CYP17A1 gene: a G-to-A transition, resulting in a trp17-to-ter (W17X) substitution, and a G-to-T transversion at the fifth nucleotide from the splice donor site in intron 2 (IVS2+5G-T;\u00a0609300.0017). The patient presented with female genitalia, a 46,XY karyotype, absent pubertal development, and hypertension. RT-PCR analysis using RNA isolated from the testes of the patient revealed that the IVS2+5G-T mutation caused abnormal splicing; exon 2 was spliced with intron 2. Skipping exon 2 alters the translational reading frame of exon 3 and introduces a premature termination codon. In semiquantitative analysis, the majority of the transcript for IVS2+5G-T skipped exon 2.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":159,"end":168},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":172,"end":188},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":199,"end":209},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":211,"end":223},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":246,"end":258},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":273,"end":285},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":439,"end":445},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":446,"end":466},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":596,"end":604},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":605,"end":613},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":649,"end":657},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":665,"end":671},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":676,"end":689},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":731,"end":752},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":835,"end":842},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T1"}]}
