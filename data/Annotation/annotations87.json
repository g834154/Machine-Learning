(1997)\u00a0described a patient who was a compound heterozygote for a C29R mutation (612779.0004) and an arg886-to-his (R886H) substitution. By assaying recombinant C29R mutant enzyme, they found that C29R had no detectable\u00a0DPYD\u00a0activity; however, R886H showed activity about 40% of normal. The authors concluded that the C29R mutation alone was sufficient to explain the DPD-deficient phenotype and that the R886H mutation was probably a rare polymorphism","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":84,"end":92},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":136,"end":148},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":179,"end":185},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":192},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":219,"end":221},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":222,"end":246},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":270,"end":278},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":336,"end":344},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":424,"end":432},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}
