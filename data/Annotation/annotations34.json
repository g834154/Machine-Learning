(1994)\u00a0found a thr877-to-ala mutation in the hormone-binding domain of the\u00a0AR\u00a0gene. The same mutation had been reported previously in a metastatic prostatic cancer cell line where it conferred on the androgen receptor an altered ligand-binding specificity that was stimulated by estrogens, progestagens, and antiandrogens.\u00a0Gaddipati et al. (1994)\u00a0suggested that the codon 877 mutant\u00a0AR\u00a0with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer. The stimulatory effect of the usual therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant\u00a0AR\u00a0may contribute to treatment-refractory disease.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":170,"end":178},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":194,"end":201},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":212,"end":223},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":234,"end":242},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":324,"end":336},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":370,"end":396},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":517,"end":531},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":532,"end":539},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":547,"end":554},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":579,"end":585},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":586,"end":595},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":724,"end":737},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T1"}]}
