(2012)\u00a0identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2185 of the DHTHD1 gene resulting in a gly-to-arg substitution at codon 729 (G729R). In 1 patient the G729R mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with a mutation involving the initiator methionine (614984.0001), and in the other patient a premature termination mutation was found (R410X;\u00a0614984.0003). In the first patient the G729R mutation occurred de novo and in the second it was maternally transmitted. Gly729 is evolutionarily conserved from Homo sapiens to C. elegans and D. melanogaster. This mutation (rs117225135) was found in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server with a minor allele frequency of 0.17%, corresponding to 19 heterozygous but no homozygous carriers among 5,379 individuals.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":131},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":154,"end":169},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":170,"end":182},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":196,"end":208},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":254,"end":262},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":307,"end":315},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":393,"end":414},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":415,"end":423},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":487,"end":495},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":655,"end":663},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"}]}
