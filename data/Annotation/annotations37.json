(2011)\u00a0identified a complex rearrangement that resulted in the patient having a single AKR1C1 (600449)/AKR1C2\u00a0hybrid on allele 1, and paternal AKR1C1, an AKR1C1/AKR1C2\u00a0hybrid, and maternal\u00a0AKR1C2\u00a0genes on allele 2. The intact maternal\u00a0AKR1C2\u00a0gene on allele 2 carried a 666T-G transversion in exon 9, resulting in a his222-to-gln (H222Q) substitution. The mutation was not found in 200 controls, and functional analysis demonstrated markedly reduced activity compared to wildtype.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":111,"end":124},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":130,"end":141},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":170,"end":176},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":186,"end":192},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":226,"end":232},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":237,"end":243},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":244,"end":250},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":272,"end":284},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":318,"end":329},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":359,"end":371},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":383,"end":395},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":420,"end":432},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":438,"end":446},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":524,"end":531},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":532,"end":540},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"}]}
