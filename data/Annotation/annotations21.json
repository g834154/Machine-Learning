(2009)\u00a0identified the R130C substitution in a patient with HSD10 deficiency reported by\u00a0Sutton et al. (2003). The patient had a severe phenotype with seizures and visual loss, and died at age 10 years.\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)\u00a0stated that the R130C substitution resulted from a 419C-T transition in exon 4 of the\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0gene. Fibroblast\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0protein levels were about 50% of normal controls, but enzyme activity was less than 1.4% of normal values. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the mutant protein had almost no catalytic activity toward allopregnanolone or 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA.\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)\u00a0postulated that the neurologic phenotype was due to an imbalance in neurosteroid metabolism.\u00a0Yang (2014)\u00a0corrected the nucleotide transition to 388C-T.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":40,"end":52},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":71,"end":76},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":255,"end":267},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":268,"end":281},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":291,"end":301},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":315,"end":332},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":334,"end":368},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":408,"end":423},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":515,"end":529},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":530,"end":533},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":544,"end":562},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":660,"end":680},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":695,"end":704},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":708,"end":731},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":770,"end":780},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T4"}]}
