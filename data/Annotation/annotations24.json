(2010)\u00a0identified a hemizygous c.257A-G transition in exon 3 of the\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0gene, resulting in an asp86-to-gly (D86G) substitution. Patient fibroblasts showed about 30% residual enzymatic activity. The patient had absent neurologic development and died of progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at age 7 months. Patient cells showed punctate and fragmented mitochondrial organization. Transfection of D86G-mutated\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0into\u00a0HSD17B10-null cells failed to rescue apoptosis. The findings suggested that the mutation causes a defect in mitochondrial function, which is responsible for clinical features of the disorder.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":31,"end":36},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":120,"end":130},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":144,"end":161},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":163,"end":175},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":199,"end":211},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":259,"end":277},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":302,"end":324},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":598},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":632,"end":640},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T1"}]}
