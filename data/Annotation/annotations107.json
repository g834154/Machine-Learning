(2005) identified a heterozygous 4465C-A transversion in exon 23 of the SCN1A gene, resulting in a gln1489-to-lys (Q1489K) substitution in the cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV, which is critical for fast inactivation. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue of the protein and was not identified in 1400 control chromosomes. Functional expression studies showed that the Q1489K substitution resulted in a 2- to 4-fold faster recovery from fast inactivation. The mutation was predicted to allow higher neuronal firing rates and enhanced excitability. Dichgans et al. (2005) suggested that the mutation may facilitate initiation and propagation of cortical spreading depression, which is thought to be related to migraine aura\r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":146,"end":158},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":173,"end":187},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":201},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":228,"end":240},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":322,"end":334},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":340,"end":348},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":393,"end":400},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":506,"end":518},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":546,"end":552},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":553,"end":561},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":572,"end":584},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":590,"end":598},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":622,"end":628},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":655,"end":663},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":664,"end":676},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":720,"end":728},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":733,"end":743},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":744,"end":754},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":759,"end":770},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T15"}]}
