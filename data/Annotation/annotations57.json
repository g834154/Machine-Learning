(2012)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.300delA) in exon 6 of the\u00a0DNAJC19\u00a0gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Ala100fsTer11). The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in a cohort of 22 children with cardiomyopathy. Western blot analysis of patient cells showed no detectable\u00a0DNAJC19\u00a0protein. The brothers had noncompaction cardiomyopathy, which resulted in death in 1 patient at age 13 months.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":128,"end":136},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":162,"end":178},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":180,"end":192},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":195,"end":205},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":210,"end":231},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":298,"end":306},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":435,"end":451},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T1"}]}
