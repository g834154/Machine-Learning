(2015)identified compound heterozygous mutations in the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene: a single-basepair insertion (c.129dupA), and a c.1033G-A transition (610690.0007). The c.129dupA frameshift mutation introduces a stop codon 8 amino acids downstream. The missense c.1033G-A mutation predicts a gly345 to ser (G345S) change affecting the substrate binding pocket and was predicted to be damaging, with a Polyphen2 score of 0.997.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":141,"end":150},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":154,"end":168},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":188,"end":197},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":227,"end":237},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":267,"end":277},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":278,"end":286},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":360,"end":368},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":433,"end":440},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":472,"end":480},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}
