(2011)\u00a0identified homozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame deletion (648CTC) in exon 8 of the\u00a0COLEC11\u00a0gene, resulting in the deletion of a highly conserved serine residue (ser217del) in the carbohydrate recognition domain. The mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in the family, and the mutation was not found in 192 Saudi control chromosomes.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":123,"end":131},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":154,"end":170},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":172,"end":184},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":197},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":291,"end":298},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":359,"end":367},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"}]}
