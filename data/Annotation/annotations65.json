(1995)\u00a0identified a 1-bp deletion of a G in amino acid 438 in the CYP17A1 gene. The deletion altered the reading frame and resulted in a premature stop codon at position 443. The ligand of heme iron, cystine-442, was absent. The truncated protein showed normal amino acid residues 1-437 and abnormal amino acid residues 438-442. The mutation caused loss of an AvaII restriction site which was used to demonstrate that the mother and a sister were heterozygous for the mutation.\u00a0Oshiro et al. (1995)reported that 16\u00a0CYP17\u00a0allelic variants had been reported","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":148,"end":156},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":185,"end":201},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":207,"end":215},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":216,"end":223},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":228,"end":241},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":246,"end":257},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":260,"end":274},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":340,"end":346},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":352,"end":361},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":456,"end":464},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":472,"end":476},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":591,"end":599},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":652,"end":660},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T1"}]}
