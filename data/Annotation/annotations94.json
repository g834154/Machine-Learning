(2012)\u00a0identified a homozygous 4-bp deletion (1167delTCAG) in a canonical splice site of the\u00a0SERAC1\u00a0gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 12 and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutation was not found in 369 controls. The patient, who was originally reported as patient 1 by\u00a0Wortmann et al. (2006), had recurrent infections, failure to thrive, mental retardation, spasticity and extrapyramidal symptoms, deafness, hypoglycemia, increased serum lactate, abnormal lesions on brain imaging, and oxidative phosphorylation defects.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":125,"end":133},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":178,"end":193},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":207},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":212,"end":220},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":254,"end":264},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":270,"end":278},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T2"}]}
