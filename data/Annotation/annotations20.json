(2008)\u00a0identified a germline T-to-C transition in the KDR gene, resulting in a cys482-to-arg (C482R) substitution in the extracellular region. The same change was identified in 8 of 105 additional individuals with hemangioma and in 12 of 295 controls. Expression of FLT1 (165070) in hemangioma endothelial cells was markedly reduced, and KDR activity was increased, compared to controls. In normal endothelial cells, FLT1 transcription is dependent on NFAT (see, e.g., NFATC2;\u00a0600490) activation. Further studies indicated that low VEGFR1 expression in hemangioma cells was caused by reduced activity of a pathway involving ITGB1 (135630), TEM8 (ANTXR1;606410), KDR, and NFAT. The KDR mutation was predicted to result in loss of function and disruption of the normal association of these molecules, leading to an increased risk for development of hemangioma.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":110,"end":120},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":128,"end":136},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":138,"end":150},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":175,"end":187},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":226,"end":232},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":326,"end":336},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":340,"end":344},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":399,"end":406},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":412,"end":415},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":416,"end":424},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":429,"end":438},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":491,"end":495},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":496,"end":509},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":513,"end":525},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":526,"end":530},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":559,"end":569},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":602,"end":605},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":606,"end":612},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":613,"end":623},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":648,"end":657},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":658,"end":665},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":666,"end":674},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":680,"end":687},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":698,"end":703},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":714,"end":718},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":736,"end":739},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":755,"end":758},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":759,"end":767},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":795,"end":799},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":803,"end":811},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":816,"end":826},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":841,"end":852},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":897,"end":901},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":906,"end":931},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R19","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R22","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R23","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R24","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R25","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R26","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T35","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R27","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T36","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R28","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R29","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R30","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R31","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R32","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R33","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R34","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T37","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R35","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T38","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R36","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T38"},{"id":"R37","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R38","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R39","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T31","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R41","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T33","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R42","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R43","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R44","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T32","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R46","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T34","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R47","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T34"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
