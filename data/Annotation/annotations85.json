The patient had been hospitalized for upper airway infection and was being investigated for unexplained hypokalemia. However, there were no convulsions or other neurologic abnormalities. By assaying recombinant C29R mutant enzyme, they found that C29R had no detectable\u00a0DPYD activity; however, R886H showed activity about 40% of normal. The authors concluded that the C29R mutation alone was sufficient to explain the DPD-deficient phenotype and that the R886H mutation was probably a rare polymorphism.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":80,"end":92},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":324,"end":330},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":331,"end":337},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":364,"end":366},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":367,"end":382},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":383,"end":391},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":415,"end":423},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":481,"end":489},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":569,"end":577},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"}]}
