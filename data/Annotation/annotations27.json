(1982),Schwartz et al. (1997)\u00a0identified a 1553A-T transversion in the NR0B1 gene, resulting in an asn440-to-ile (N440I) substitution. The substitution represented change from a polar amino acid to a nonpolar amino acid. Both patients who had reached the age of puberty exhibited hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The authors noted that among 33 female relatives at risk for the mutation, they identified 10 as carriers and excluded 23 from being carriers, information important for genetic counseling\r\ndetermined that the N440I mutation results in impaired RNA-binding activity of the\u00a0DAX1protein","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":155,"end":167},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":171,"end":185},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":187,"end":199},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":225,"end":237},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":243,"end":255},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":480,"end":488},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":630,"end":638},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":650,"end":658},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":663,"end":670},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":671,"end":679},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":687,"end":698},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
