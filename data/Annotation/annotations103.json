(2015)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.1685delT, NM_030813.3) in the\u00a0CLPB\u00a0gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Ile562ThrfsTer23). The mutation was found by a combination of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Sequencing Project databases, or in 657 in-house control exomes. The patients had a severe phenotype: at birth they did not move or breathe spontaneously and showed sustained clonic movements induced by minimal tactile stimulation; all were ventilator-dependent and died in the first week of life after removal of respiratory support.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":216,"end":224},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":267},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":269,"end":281},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":294},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":299,"end":320},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":345,"end":353},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"}]}
