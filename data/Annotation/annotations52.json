(2015)\u00a0found that transfection of the E102Q mutation into neuro2A cells resulted in dissociation of the mutant protein from the ER membrane and subsequent cytoplasmic aggregation. This was associated with disruption of mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial damage, decreased ATP production, and autophagic cell death. Cells overexpressing E102Q showed aberrant extranuclear localization of TDP43 (605078), a hallmark of ALS.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":60,"end":68},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":88,"end":99},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":100,"end":112},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":120,"end":126},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":127,"end":134},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":183,"end":194},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":221,"end":231},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":274,"end":280},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":282,"end":291},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":296,"end":306},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":328,"end":333},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":391,"end":403},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"}]}
