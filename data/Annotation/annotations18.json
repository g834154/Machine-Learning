See also\u00a0TPMT*3B (A154T;\u00a0187680.0004) andTPMT*3C (Y240C;\u00a0187680.0005).\r\nIn 4 individuals with decreased\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity (610460),\u00a0Szumlanski et al. (1996)\u00a0identified homozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene: a 460G-A transition in exon 7 resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T) substitution, and a 719A-G transition in exon 10 resulting in a tyr240-to-cys (Y240C) substitution. Three liver samples from individuals with intermediate\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity were heterozygous for the 2 mutations. In vitro functional expression studies showed that each mutation independently, as well as both together, resulted in decreased expression of\u00a0TPMT\u00a0enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":158,"end":167},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":168,"end":172},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":173,"end":181},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":247,"end":256},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":260,"end":273},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":284,"end":294},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":305,"end":317},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":343,"end":355},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":370,"end":380},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":392,"end":404},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":429,"end":441},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":485,"end":511},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":540,"end":549},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":607,"end":615},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":657,"end":668},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":669,"end":689},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":690,"end":707},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":708,"end":716},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"}]}
