(2014)\u00a0identified a de novo heterozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 10 of the\u00a0PIK3R1\u00a0gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of exon 10 and removal of a peptide sequence that is part of an alpha-helix involved in p110 binding. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not found in the Exome Variant Server database or in an in-house control database. The same splice site mutation, resulting from a different nucleotide change (171833.0008), was found in 3 additional patients with a similar disorder. Both mutations resulted in a loss of p85-mediated inhibition and caused increased phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways, consistent with a gain of function. Immunologic studies showed a defect in both B- and T-cell differentiation.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":115,"end":127},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":144,"end":159},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":161,"end":173},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":194},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":288,"end":295},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":301,"end":309},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":497,"end":505},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":507,"end":521},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":632,"end":641},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":656,"end":660},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":677,"end":687},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":699,"end":708},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":709,"end":724},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":739,"end":748},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":749,"end":757},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":777,"end":781},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":785,"end":793},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":824,"end":830},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
