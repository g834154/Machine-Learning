(2001)\u00a0identified an acceptor splice site mutation in the\u00a0OPA3\u00a0gene, IVS1-1G-C, as the cause of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III (258501), or optic atrophy plus syndrome, in several Iraqi Jewish patients. The mutation abolished mRNA expression in the patients' fibroblasts. The mutation was also detected in 8 of 85 healthy ethnically matched controls, yielding a carrier frequency of 1 in 10 and indicating a founder effect.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":58,"end":66},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":70,"end":83},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":229,"end":237},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":238,"end":247},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":253,"end":263},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":298,"end":306},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T1"}]}
