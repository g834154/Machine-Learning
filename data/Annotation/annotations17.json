(1991),\u00a0Krynetski et al. (1995)\u00a0identified a 238G-C transversion in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene, resulting in an ala80-to-pro (A80P) substitution. The patient developed severe hematologic toxicity after conventional therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with oral mercaptopurine. Functional expression studies in a yeast heterologous expression system showed that the A80P mutant enzyme had a 100-fold reduction in\u00a0TPMT\u00a0catalytic activity compared to the wildtype enzyme, despite a comparable level of mRNA expression. A mutation-specific PCR amplification method was developed and used to detect the same mutation in genomic DNA of the proposita and her mother.\u00a0Krynetski et al. (1995)\u00a0concluded that the patient had a second inactivating mutation.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":241,"end":253},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":257,"end":270},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":272,"end":284},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":308,"end":320},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":551,"end":564},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":589},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":593,"end":597},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":598,"end":607},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":608,"end":616},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":685,"end":695},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":784,"end":792},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":918,"end":926},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"}]}
