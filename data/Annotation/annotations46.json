(2008)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a 1139G-A transition in the\u00a0GDF5\u00a0gene, resulting in an arg380-to-gln (R380Q) substitution at the P2 position of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase processing site. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members. Analysis of the R380Q mutant in chicken micromass cultures demonstrated secretion of the mutant but showed a severe reduction in biologic activity. Western blot analyses showed that the mutation interferes with\u00a0GDF5\u00a0processing, and studies in E. coli confirmed that unprocessed proGDF5 is virtually inactive","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":158,"end":168},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":172,"end":185},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":187,"end":199},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":225,"end":237},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":323,"end":331},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":398,"end":404},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":465,"end":471},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":492,"end":501},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":505,"end":522},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":562,"end":570},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":571,"end":581},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":582,"end":602},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":654,"end":661},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":675,"end":683},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"}]}
