(1988)demonstrated a 4-base duplication in exon 8 of the CYP17A1 gene. The resultant protein had an altered C-terminal amino acid sequence which resulted in loss of both enzymatic activities. This mutation was also found in affected members of 2 presumably unrelated Canadian Mennonite families (Kagimoto et al., 1989).\u000B\u000BImai et al. (1992)\u00a0identified the CYP17A1 4-bp duplication in affected members of 6 families residing in the Friesland region of the Netherlands. Since the Mennonite sect derives its name from Menno Simons, the founder of the group in Friesland in the 16th century, the 4-bp duplication presumably appeared within the population before the migration of the Mennonites from the Netherlands to Canada","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":125,"end":136},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":150,"end":166},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":197,"end":204},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":254,"end":258},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":267,"end":287},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":294,"end":302},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":452,"end":459},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":465,"end":476},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":693,"end":704},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"}]}
