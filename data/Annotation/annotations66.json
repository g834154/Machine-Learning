(1996)\u00a0identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 1 of the CYP17A1 gene, resulting in an arg96-to-trp (R96W) substitution. Functional expression studies showed that the mutation almost completely abolished the activity of the mutant protein.\u00a0Laflamme et al. (1996)\u00a0pointed out that 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency impairs steroid biosynthesis in the adrenals and gonads; in contrast to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (201910), caused by 21-alpha-hydroxylase or 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, in which steroid formation is impaired exclusively in the adrenals","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":218,"end":228},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":242,"end":258},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":260,"end":272},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":296,"end":308},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":356,"end":364},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":383,"end":392},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":397,"end":405},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":413,"end":419},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":502,"end":512},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":513,"end":520},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":529,"end":541},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":680,"end":690},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":709,"end":718},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":722,"end":730},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T1"}]}
