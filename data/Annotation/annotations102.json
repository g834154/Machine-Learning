(2015)\u00a0identified a homozygous c.803C-T transition (rs200032855) in the\u00a0CLPB\u00a0gene, resulting in a thr268-to-met (T268M) substitution at a highly conserved residue in 1 of the ankyrin domains. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping and candidate gene sequencing, segregated with the disorder in 1 of the families. The carrier frequency of the mutation in Greenlandic controls was found to be 3.3%. The variant was not found in 2,180 control samples in the U.S. or in the Exome Variant Server database, but was reported with a carrier frequency of 1 out of 662 in the ClinSeq database.
