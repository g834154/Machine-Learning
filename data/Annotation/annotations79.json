(2013)\u00a0identified a homozygous c.950G-A transition in the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene (c.950G-A, NM_014362.2), resulting in a gly317-to-glu (G317E) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation, which was found by direct sequencing of the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene, segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project databases. Fibroblast activity of\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0was below the level of detection in both patients.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":185,"end":195},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":199,"end":213},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":239,"end":251},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":276,"end":288},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":324,"end":332},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":374,"end":388},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":519,"end":531},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}
