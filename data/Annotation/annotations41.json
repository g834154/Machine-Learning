(2009) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the SLC12A1 gene: a 724+4A-G transition in intron 5, predicted to result in skipping of exon 5 with creation of a premature stop codon in exon 6, and a 1-bp deletion in exon 16 (2095delG; 600839.0005), predicted to cause an immediate stop codon and premature termination of the protein. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations; the intronic mutation was not detected in 100 controls. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from the proband's urinary sediment confirmed complete absence of exon 5 sequences, and RT-PCR results using mRNA from patient leukocytes showed no bands, indicating that the leukocytes did not express SLC12A1 mRNA. Nozu et al. (2009) stated that this was the first study to use noninvasive methods for both an in vivo assay and an in vitro functional splicing assay of inherited kidney disease.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":127,"end":136},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":140,"end":156},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":169,"end":179},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":206,"end":215},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":254,"end":268},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":297,"end":305},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":355,"end":360},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":374,"end":384},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":389,"end":410},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":418,"end":425},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":486,"end":495},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":510,"end":518},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":642,"end":649},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":777,"end":780},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":781,"end":788},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":789,"end":796},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"}]}
