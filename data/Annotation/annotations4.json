(2015)\u00a0identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 1 of the\u00a0B2M\u00a0gene (c.67+1G-T), predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination in exon 2. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 200 control chromosomes. Patient cells showed absence of the mutant transcript, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Patient lymphocytes showed no detectableB2M\u00a0surface protein expression, and undetectable serum levels of\u00a0B2M.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":146,"end":158},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":174,"end":186},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":213,"end":222},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":225,"end":235},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":240,"end":261},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":321,"end":329},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":407},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":415,"end":421},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":422,"end":432},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":473,"end":478},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":507,"end":509},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":532,"end":539},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":540,"end":550},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":556,"end":568},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":569,"end":588},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T10"}]}
