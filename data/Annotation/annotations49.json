(2011),\u00a0Flanagan et al. (2013)\u00a0identified homozygosity for a 636+471G-T transversion deep within intron 5 of the HADH gene, creating a cryptic splice donor site that results in the inclusion of an out-of-frame 141-bp pseudoexon and premature termination. The mutation was present in heterozygosity in tested parents. All 9 mutation-positive Turkish patients were also homozygous for an HADH SNP, 636+385A-G (rs732941), and 5 of the patients were known to share a 1.6-Mb haplotype at chromosome 4q25 (chr4:108,874,712-108,968,640; GRCh37).\u00a0Flanagan et al.
