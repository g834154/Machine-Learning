(2004)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for a Y329D substitution in exon 6 of the CYP17A1 gene (609300.0025) and an AG-to-CG substitution at the 3-prime end of intron 2 (IVS2ASA-C-2). In transfection studies, cells expressing the mutant gene had no 17-hydroxylase activity. The RT-PCR product derived from these cells showed that the mRNA derived from the AG-to-CG mutation used the first AG in exon 3 as the splice acceptor site, shifting the reading frame and introducing a stop codon. The patient had experienced spontaneous sexual development and irregular menses.\u00a0Costa-Santos et al. (2004)\u00a0attributed the development of secondary sexual characteristics to the presence of the Y329D mutation, which retains about 5% of wildtype 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":191,"end":203},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":217,"end":233},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":264,"end":276},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":369,"end":375},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":385,"end":387},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":388,"end":402},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":403,"end":411},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":504,"end":512},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":615,"end":625},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":827,"end":835},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":872,"end":892},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":893,"end":901},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}]}
