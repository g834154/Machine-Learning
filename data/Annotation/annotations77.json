(2011)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a c.300C-A transition in exon 3 of the\u00a0STEAP3gene, resulting in a cys100-to-ter (C100X) substitution. The mutation was inherited from their unaffected father and was not found in their unaffected mother or 200 control chromosomes. Quantitative RT-PCR from blood mRNA of all 5 family members and 10 controls showed that the\u00a0STEAP3\u00a0mRNA level was considerably lower in the 3 patients, whereas both parents had a level of\u00a0STEAP3\u00a0mRNA corresponding to the low-normal range found in controls. In B lymphocyte-cell lines treated to prevent degradation due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, quantitative sequencing of a cDNA fragment encompassing the mutated nucleotide demonstrated that expression of the normal allele relative to that of the mutated allele was significantly higher in the father than in the 3 sibs.\u00a0Grandchamp et al. (2011)\u00a0suggested that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele and 1 normal, highly expressed allele, whereas the mother had 2 weakly expressed alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated allele from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from their mother. This was supported by the fact that expression of both alleles from the mother produced an amount of mRNA that was roughly equivalent to the expression products from the single normal allele of the father.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":184,"end":194},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":208,"end":222},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":224,"end":236},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":261,"end":273},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":279,"end":287},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":503},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":508,"end":513},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":531,"end":536},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":583,"end":588},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":591,"end":599},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":816,"end":823},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":853,"end":863},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":909,"end":916},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":942,"end":948},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1213},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1332,"end":1342},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1437,"end":1447},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T8"}]}
