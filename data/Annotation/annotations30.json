(2003)\u00a0identified a C-to-A transversion in the second exon of the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0gene that resulted in the change of tyr399 to a premature stop codon (Y399X), which truncates the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0protein by 71 amino acids. Kindred analysis established that the mutation had been inherited from the proband's mother. The proband, his deceased brother, and a maternal cousin were hemizygous for the mutation. The mutation was associated with loss of Leydig cell responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin (see\u00a0118860); the 35-year-old proband exhibited hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Immunohistochemical analysis of testicular tissue obtained from the proband's affected sib, who had died from adrenal failure as a neonate, showed normal testicular morphology and expression of\u00a0DAX1, steroidogenic factor-1 (184757), and anti-mullerian hormone (600957). Transient transfection assays demonstrated that the mutation resulted in a severe loss of\u00a0DAX1\u00a0repressor activity","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":143,"end":155},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":178,"end":191},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":197,"end":208},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":235,"end":255},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":281,"end":297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":355,"end":363},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":491,"end":499},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":505,"end":513},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":534,"end":538},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":549,"end":568},"obj":"Cell_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":860,"end":870},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":871,"end":878},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1010},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1036},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1063},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T15"}]}
