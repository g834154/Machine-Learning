Although the mutant protein retained the ability to bind the partner protein GATA4 (600576) and repress GATA4-mediated gene activation, it was subtly impaired in this function.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":107,"end":117},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":121,"end":135},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":137,"end":149},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":174,"end":182},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":203},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":204,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":236,"end":240},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":253,"end":260},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":280,"end":287},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":303,"end":318},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":334,"end":342},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":351,"end":359},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T12"}]}
