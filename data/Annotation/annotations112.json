(2012) identified a heterozygous 2159T-A transversion in the SCN9A gene, resulting in an ile720-to-lys (I720K) substitution in the cytoplasmic linker-1 region between domains I and II. The mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes. The patient developed stabbing pain in the whole body at age 37 years. Two months later, he also had burning pain in the feet and lower legs, followed by pain in the lower arms. He also had numbness and hyperhidrosis in the feet. He had distally impaired warmth sensation and decreased intraepithelial nerve fiber density compared to controls. In vitro functional expression and electrophysiologic studies in HEK293 and dorsal root ganglion neurons showed that the mutant I720K protein resulted in impaired slow inactivation and hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion cells. I720K caused a depolarizing shift in the resting membrane potential and an increase in the number of action potentials evoked by a depolarizing stimulus compared to control. Activation, fast-inactivation, and ramp currents were similar to wildtype. \r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":151},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":155,"end":169},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":171,"end":183},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":209,"end":221},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":287,"end":295},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":803,"end":809},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":816,"end":823},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":836,"end":844},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":850,"end":862},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":867,"end":884},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":922,"end":928},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":931,"end":949},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":991,"end":999},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1034},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
