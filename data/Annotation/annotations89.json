(2013)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a 969C-A transversion in the\u00a0OPLAH\u00a0gene, resulting in a ser323-to-arg (S323R) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the first domain, near an ATP-binding site. The presence of a large deletion or duplication was excluded by gel electrophoresis. The patient's asymptomatic mother was also heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in her father or in 128 controls.","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":240,"end":252},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":256,"end":270},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":284},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":309,"end":321},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":385,"end":392},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":423,"end":431},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":435,"end":446},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":548,"end":556},"obj":"Variation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"}]}
