(2005)\u00a0detected homozygosity for a C-to-A transversion in exon 1 of the CYP17A1 gene that introduced a stop codon in place of tyrosine at codon 27 (Y27X). The patient's steroid metabolism showed increased levels of mineralocorticoid precursors and low or undetectable plasma concentrations of 17-alpha-hydroxycorticoids, androgens, and estrogens before and after ACTH stimulation. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry urinary steroid profile was dominated by metabolites of corticosterone and its precursors, while cortisol and C19-steroid metabolites were lacking. ACTH, FSH (see\u00a0136530), and LH (see\u00a0152780) levels were elevated","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":251,"end":263},"obj":"Variation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":277,"end":293},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":312,"end":322},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":404,"end":413},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":414,"end":420},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":457,"end":460},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":464,"end":476},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":753,"end":764},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":770,"end":777},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":823,"end":829},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":835,"end":843},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
